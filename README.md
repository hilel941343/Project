# 🎓 Graduation Project - Recipe Sharing Website
As part of my final graduation project, I developed a recipe sharing platform using the Django web framework.
The project was built following the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methodology, allowing users to:

Add their own recipes

Browse and view existing recipes

Edit their submitted recipes

Delete their recipes if needed

# 🌟 Key Features:
📸 Image Uploads: Each recipe includes a beautiful image to showcase the dish.

🎨 Modern & Clean UI: The interface is user-friendly, visually appealing, and includes colorful backgrounds for a pleasant browsing experience.

🔐 User Authentication: Only registered users can contribute content and manage their own submissions.

💻 Responsive Design: The website is designed to be functional and attractive on both desktop and mobile devices.

I put a lot of thought into the design and functionality to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for users.
I hope you like it! 😊
